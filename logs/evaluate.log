[2026-01-16 21:55:52,104] [INFO] QID: 1, Verdict: Good (4), Reason: Misses nuances like differing redundancy/performance isolation benefits of separate pools.
[2026-01-16 21:55:52,556] [INFO] QID: 1, Verdict: Good (4), Reason: Doesn’t discuss potential benefits of a separate pool’s isolation or redundancy choices.
[2026-01-16 21:55:52,596] [INFO] QID: 1, Verdict: Good (4), Reason: Lacks specific pros/cons of separate pool versus additional backup.
