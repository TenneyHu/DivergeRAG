Great — with 10 years’ experience you should focus on deepening breadth where it matters and on deliberate practice. Below are concise, practical, high-impact actions (with examples) you can start right away.  Daily / weekly habits - Code every day (or most days). Do focused, deliberate practice — small projects, refactors, bug hunts, or katas — 30–90 minutes daily to keep skills sharp and build confidence.   - Practice projects: pick one medium project every 2–3 months that stretches you (e.g., a realtime feature, a headless CMS site, or a microservice).  Skill expansion (pick 2–3 priorities) - Learn a new paradigm/language or framework that complements your stack (e.g., TypeScript if you’re on JS, Rust/Go for backend systems, React→Next.js for SSR).   - Deep-dive into architecture topics: system design, microservices, event-driven systems, scalability patterns, and cloud-native design (AWS/GCP/Azure + containers/Kubernetes).   - Improve non-functional skills: performance engineering, security best practices (OWASP), testing strategies (unit, integration, contract), accessibility (WCAG), and observability (logging/metrics/tracing).  Practical portfolio & visibility - Maintain a portfolio showing recent, relevant work and write short posts about technical decisions or postmortems — blogging raises your profile and clarifies thinking.   - Contribute to open-source or publish small reusable libraries/components — it’s both practice and credibility.  Learning channels - Join and participate in communities (Stack Overflow, relevant Slack/Discord, GitHub discussions). Learn from reading/answering questions.   - Take targeted courses or workshops for concrete outcomes (system design, security, cloud architecture). Use project-focused bootcamps if you want fast, applied learning.   - Read high-quality editorial/tutorial sites regularly (examples: Smashing Magazine, SitePoint, TutsPlus) to stay current.  Collaboration & feedback - Pair program, do regular code reviews, and mentor juniors — teaching exposes gaps and reinforces knowledge.   - Seek structured feedback: architecture reviews, one-on-one mentoring, or a technical coach.  Challenges & events - Join hackathons, coding competitions, or architecture kata events to push quick problem-solving and collaboration under time pressure.  Concrete 90-day plan (example) - Weeks 1–2: pick priority (e.g., performance or cloud). Setup a project and baseline metrics.   - Weeks 3–8: daily coding + 1 focused course + contribute a PR to an open-source repo. Publish one blog post reflecting what you learned.   - Weeks 9–12: do an architecture or performance refactor, run load tests, present the results in a meetup or write a detailed post.  Keep measurable goals - Define 2–4 measurable outcomes (e.g., ship an authenticated microservice with CI/CD and observability; reduce page load by X%; merge 3 OSS PRs; publish 3 technical posts).  Tools & meta - Invest time in mastering your editor/IDE, browser devtools, CI/CD pipelines, and performance/security scanning tools to be more productive.  If you tell me your current stack and 2 goals (technical and career), I’ll give a tailored 90-day plan with specific resources and project ideas.
With 10 years of web dev experience you can level up most by shifting some effort from pure implementation to owning outcomes — understanding users, the domain, and how technical choices change business results. Practical, high‑impact moves:  What to practice - Run discovery end‑to‑end: lead or pair on user interviews, synthesize findings into personas and journeys, turn problems into measurable hypotheses. - Learn the domain workflows and constraints: map business processes, talk to support/sales/ops, read regulations/industry reports, and model core entities and edge cases. - Get fluent in business metrics: identify 3–5 north‑star and funnel metrics (eg. acquisition, activation, retention, conversion, LTV/CAC); learn cohort and funnel analysis so you can quantify impact. - Instrument and measure: add analytics/telemetry (Amplitude/Mixpanel/GA4, or analytics + event schema), define baselines, run A/B tests, and report results. - Prioritize with frameworks: use RICE/ICE/Kano/Cost‑of‑Delay and OKRs to trade off scope, effort, risk, and expected value. - Design trade‑offs clearly: practice writing brief trade‑off documents that show options, costs, risks, metrics affected, and recommended choice. - Improve cross‑functional leadership: run discovery workshops, write crisp PRDs/specs, facilitate design/dev/PM alignment, present decisions to stakeholders. - Tie architecture to outcomes: when choosing patterns (caching, queues, multi‑tenant, data stores), state how they affect cost, performance, time‑to‑market, and product KPIs.  Concrete skills & tools to learn - Analytics & querying: SQL, BigQuery/Looker/Metabase, cohort/funnel analysis. - Experimentation: A/B testing frameworks and interpretation. - UX research basics: interview technique, journey mapping, usability testing. - Product frameworks: Jobs‑to‑Be‑Done, user story mapping, hypothesis‑driven development. - Observability: Prometheus/Grafana, Sentry, logging for product and reliability metrics.  Resources (short list) - Books: Inspired (Marty Cagan), Escaping the Build Trap (Melissa Perri), Measure What Matters (John Doerr), Lean UX. - Courses: product management/Reforge or Coursera product/UX tracks; NN/g for UX research. - Hands‑on: instrument an app with Amplitude/Mixpanel + run an A/B test.  How to get started (first 30–90 days) 1. Join three customer calls or shadow support/sales to capture top pain points. 2. Pick one feature/flow and define a measurable hypothesis (metric, baseline, target); instrument events and build a dashboard. 3. Run a small experiment or launch a focused improvement, then present results and the trade‑offs considered.  Outcomes you’ll deliver - Faster, higher‑impact decisions, clearer prioritization, measurable product improvements, better stakeholder alignment, and the ability to justify technical choices by business value.  If you want, tell me your product/domain (SaaS, e‑commerce, fintech, etc.) and one pain area you see — I’ll give a 60–90 day plan tailored to it.
With 10 years of experience you should shift from only deepening technical skills to deliberately multiplying your impact through leadership, product influence, and organizational practices. Practical, prioritized actions:  1. Own technical vision and roadmaps - Propose and own a 6–12 month technical roadmap for your service/area (prioritized by risk, customer value, and velocity).   - Run quarterly roadmap reviews with engineering + product; track progress against a few clear KPIs (latency, error rate, lead time, throughput).  2. Lead architecture and reliability work - Take responsibility for system design reviews, tech debt tranches, and SLO/SLIs.   - Run postmortems and introduce recurring reliability improvements; measure MTTR and incident recurrence.  3. Build and scale teams - Participate in hiring end-to-end: write job specs, design interview tasks, run interviews, and give structured feedback.   - Start a mentorship program: pair with juniors, track mentee growth (skill checkpoints, ownership of tasks).  4. Improve stakeholder management and influence - Map stakeholders (Power/Interest grid) for major initiatives; create a simple register (role, influence, communication plan).   - Establish cadences: monthly stakeholder review, biweekly check-ins for fast-moving projects; document decisions and follow-ups.   - Practice active listening in one‑on‑ones; surface trade‑offs to product and leadership with clear data and options.  5. Increase cross-functional impact - Run joint planning sessions with Product, Design, QA to align priorities and acceptance criteria.   - Use RACI for major deliverables to clarify responsibilities and reduce rework.  6. Amplify through process and metrics - Introduce measurable goals (OKRs or team KPIs) that link engineering work to business outcomes.   - Improve delivery flow (CI/CD pipelines, test coverage, deployment frequency) and report improvements.  7. Grow as a communicator and influencer - Start presenting technical strategy to execs and product using concise, non-technical slides focused on outcomes and risks.   - Publish postmortems, design docs, or blog posts; speak at internal brown-bags or meetups to build credibility.  8. Continue deliberate technical growth - Keep up with system design, backend best practices, databases, cloud patterns, and security. Use resources like backend roadmaps and targeted courses (e.g., advanced SQL, distributed systems).   - Ship projects: choose 1–2 high-impact initiatives per year that stretch your skills (e.g., migrate to a microservice, implement event-driven architecture, or scale a service 10x).  9. Institutionalize learning and feedback - Run regular retrospectives and collect stakeholder sentiment; adjust engagement plans when support wanes.   - Document onboarding, runbooks, and architecture decisions so knowledge scales beyond you.  Quick first 90-day plan - Week 1–2: Map stakeholders and current pain points; propose one measurable improvement.   - Week 3–8: Draft a 6‑month technical roadmap + KPIs; start one pilot (reliability, performance, or delivery).   - Month 3: Run a hiring/mentorship pilot and present roadmap progress to stakeholders.  Pick 2–3 of the above to focus on this quarter (e.g., roadmap + stakeholder register + mentorship). Deliver concrete artifacts and metrics for each — those make influence visible and sustainable.
With ten years of web development experience you should broaden from coding to operating and growing software that other people depend on. Focus on deepening technical breadth, and on the practices that make projects healthy, sustainable, and influential.  Concrete, high-impact actions  - Contribute to active OSS projects (not just code): start with issues, bug fixes, docs, tests, then move to larger features and reviews. Projects like Theia/Che or other cloud-native tools are good targets to learn large-project dynamics. - Lead a small open-source project or take maintainer responsibility for a module. Running a repo teaches release cadence, contributor onboarding, triage, and long-term maintenance. - Create and improve contributor-facing docs: README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue/PR templates, onboarding guides. Good docs reduce friction for new contributors. - Design and document governance and processes: define roles, decision rules, release policy, and a roadmap. Clear governance prevents conflicts and scales community work. - Implement sustainability and succession planning: document maintenance tasks, automate repetitive work, identify and mentor potential successors, and plan for handover if maintainers depart. - Learn/operate modern CI/CD and build infra: set up pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins on Kubernetes/OpenShift), containerized builds, cross-platform agents, and automated releases. Reliable automation reduces maintenance cost and improves trust. - Improve contributor experience by integrating modern tools: issue triage automation, CI badges, bots for PR checks, and easy signing of contributor agreements (e.g., HelloSign/DCO/CLA workflows). - Master licensing, IP, and compliance basics: choose and explain a license, understand contributor agreements and third-party dependencies. This reduces legal risk for users and adopters. - Measure community health: track active contributors, retention, PR/issue response times, release frequency, user installs/uptime. Use these metrics to prioritize improvements. - Run community-building activities: host virtual events, office hours, release notes, and webinars to grow adoption and contributors. Help prepare press-friendly release announcements. - Mentor and onboard contributors: pair-program, review PRs promptly, and create small good-first-issue lists. Mentorship multiplies project capacity. - Practice ecosystem thinking: collaborate with adjacent projects, standardize integrations, and participate in working groups or specification processes to influence broader direction. - Gain cloud-native ops skills: learn Kubernetes, OpenShift, service observability, and platform engineering so you can operate projects at scale. - Read and apply lessons on project longevity and stewardship (succession planning, funding models, and distributed ownership) to avoid single-point-of-failure projects.  First three things to do this month  1. Pick one mature project you care about and submit a meaningful contribution (bugfix + tests or docs).   2. Create or improve that project’s CONTRIBUTING.md and first-time-contributor workflow.   3. Set up a CI pipeline or improve existing CI to build/tests/releases automatically.  Resources to consult - Project CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, and governance docs from mature foundations (examples from Eclipse/Jakarta projects).   - Guides on CLA/DCO, open-source licensing, and succession planning (community and academic articles on OSS sustainability).   - Tutorials for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins on Kubernetes/OpenShift.  These steps will expand your technical leadership, make your work more reusable and resilient, and position you to influence software beyond individual code contributions.
Nice — with 10 years of experience you can level up by combining deeper technical skills with disciplined, outcome-focused experimentation. Practical, high-impact next steps:  1. Make experiments your default way to validate ideas    - Run small, hypothesis-driven tests (A/B with multiple variations, multivariate, painted-door) before large builds.    - Use feature flags and server-side experiments to safely roll out and iterate.  2. Measure what matters    - Tie experiments to true business metrics (revenue per user, retention, LTV, return rates) rather than vanity metrics.    - Build metrics in your warehouse so analysis uses the same source of truth and avoids reconciliation issues.  3. Improve sensitivity and speed of learning    - Learn variance-reduction techniques (e.g., CUPED) and experiment designs that increase power.    - Try bandit approaches to accelerate wins for high-traffic tests.  4. Prototype, benchmark, and iterate    - Create quick prototypes and micro-benchmarks to compare architectures or algorithms before productionizing.    - Use painted-door or concierge experiments to validate demand cheaply.  5. Read and implement targeted research    - Regularly read relevant academic and industry papers on A/B testing, causal inference, ML for personalization, and bandit algorithms — then implement small proofs-of-concept to internalize techniques.  6. Leverage AI and analytics wisely    - Use tools/techniques that suggest variations, help pick metrics, and automate traffic allocation, but keep human judgment on objectives and rollout decisions.  7. Standardize processes and share learning    - Adopt prioritization (e.g., scoring ideas by impact/importance/ease), written experiment templates, and clear review steps.    - Document results, publish learnings, and mentor others to scale experimentation across your org.  8. Skill gaps to prioritize learning now    - Advanced experiment design & statistics (power, multiple comparisons, CUPED)    - SQL + warehouse-native analytics + data engineering basics    - Feature-flagging & server-side experimentation frameworks    - Contextual bandits and personalization techniques    - Communicating business impact (tying tests to revenue/retention)  Immediate 30‑day plan    - Pick one business metric you care about, design 2 quick experiments (one A/B with multiple variations, one painted-door or prototype), instrument results in your warehouse, and run them with feature flags. Review outcomes and document learnings.  If you want, tell me one product/metric you care about and I’ll sketch two experiment ideas and the key metrics to track.
